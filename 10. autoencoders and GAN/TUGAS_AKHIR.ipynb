    "_Exercise: Try using a denoising autoencoder to pretrain an image classifier. You can use MNIST (the simplest option), or a more complex image dataset such as [CIFAR10](https://homl.info/122) if you want a bigger challenge. Regardless of the dataset you're using, follow these steps:_\n",
    "* Split the dataset into a training set and a test set. Train a deep denoising autoencoder on the full training set.\n",
    "* Check that the images are fairly well reconstructed. Visualize the images that most activate each neuron in the coding layer.\n",
    "* Build a classification DNN, reusing the lower layers of the autoencoder. Train it using only 500 images from the training set. Does it perform better with or without pretraining?"
